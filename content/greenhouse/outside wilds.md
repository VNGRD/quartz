> [!faq]- Why is this here?
> This was made as a personal response to frustration that I was experiencing with different kinds of read-later and bookmarking apps. None of them fit the bill for what I wanted to have, so I thought that I might as well make something of my own that doesn‚Äôt require an extra app or account to maintain. **Basically, this page is meant to be a sort of bookmarks and highlights list.** They are first and foremost pertinent to my current areas of interest.
> 
> The thought compilation, meanwhile, is probably just to sum up some ideas and thoughts I have that I may or may not address later. It‚Äôs meant for those annoying thoughts that suddenly pop up into your head while you‚Äôre focusing on a different thing.


> [!NOTE]- Note to self
> I probably shouldn‚Äôt delete these when I‚Äôm done with them - instead, **I should mark them as done, link them with the relevant note I probably made, and keep them here** for, well, safekeeping. The downside to this is that the articles and videos are relevant on the content staying online.
