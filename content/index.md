It feels pretentious calling this vault a “second  brain” when, in reality, it’s more akin to a Five Star™ 5 subject notebook where I just put whatever in it. I’m not sure how often my notes will see refining, and now I’m thinking that it’s more like a haphazard detective board instead of a garden - however, I’m keeping the garden metaphor because it’s cute 💖

**Current learning and research of interest:**
1. HTML & CSS via [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard) and [freeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) Responsive Web Design course
2. Foundations of the Internet and the web
3. Web revival and my personal relationship with technology

- **highlight color schemes:**
	- highlighting is provided by the obsidian plugin [Highlightr](https://github.com/chetachiezikeuzor/Highlightr-Plugin)
	- regular highlights marked as ```==equal signs==``` indicate **definitions**
	- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">orange</mark> → things that I don’t really understand; **knowledge or information that needs refining or more understanding**
	- <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">blue</mark> → important information that stands out to me; **information that, to me, needs extra emphasizing**
