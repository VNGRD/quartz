My original tags on the post:
> *”i'm SO gonna write a whole essay about this somewhere but azem!rune to me is 100000% unstoppable force. chaotic good to an unbelievable degree that its disruptive enough to where people go 'why is this man still in the convocation. why didn't they kick him out yet. it's actually ridiculous' (its bc of emet). ultimately he holds so much love for the star and all living beings in it. and in the event that he survives the sundering i don't think his attitude towards the star will change. he definitely would have disagreed with zodiark's summoning in general too. this is probably going to sound boring but with a man so dedicated to the star and its life he would still love it no matter what even if it was only a reflection of itself. with a heavy heart he will continue on even with all of the loss. i don't think he can bring himself to harm what life has cropped up after the sundering. but in the event that he breaks and becomes a villain in the eyes of the sundered. well. as much as azem holds the sun symbolism i did make him synonymous with the chariot for a reason.”*

And here comes the essay.

As mentioned, I envision Koronis to be several things:
- The unstoppable force to someone’s immovable object → *aka, the very thing that drives Rune today*
- The Chariot → a major arcana in tarot, meaning:
	- Victory, overcoming obstacles, success, ambition, determination, willpower, control, self-discipline, hard work and focus [x](https://www.thetarotguide.com/the-chariot/)
	- And according to [Labyrinthos](https://labyrinthos.co/blogs/tarot-card-meanings-list/the-chariot-meaning-major-arcana-tarot-card-meanings)
		- Upright: success, ambition, determination, willpower, control, self-discipline, focus
		- Reversed: forceful, no direction, no control, powerless, aggression, obstacles
- A person that holds so much love for Etheirys and all life in it
- Chaotic good
	- According to the D&D 3.5 PHB:
		- *”A chaotic good character acts as his conscience directs him with little regard for what others expect of him. He makes his own way, but he’s kind and benevolent. He believes in goodness and right but has little use for laws and regulations. He hates it when people try to intimidate others and tell them what to do. He follows his own moral compass, which, although good, may not agree with that of society. Chaotic good is the best alignment you can be because it combines a good heart with a free spirit.”*

Him embodying both as the Sun (as Azem) and the Chariot (as my own personal interpretation) means that he definitely leans towards the chaotic good embodiment. He works mainly for the good of the star and those that live in it, and will refuse to bring it to harm for any reason. However, I want to explore possible events in which he can break. Even with his near-superhuman tenacity, anyone can still snap.

The thing is, though, if the Final Days didn’t break him, what could? He had watched people around him succumb to despair and serve as further fuel to the apocalypse, and yet he still held his ground against the Convocation with the belief that there was something better that could save everyone. What could make a man like that break apart, if a combination of watching the people he loved die right before his eyes and the end of the world was not enough?

I think it falls to time to do so. Time erodes all things, even the strongest of wills. How would it erode him?

In the case of Emet-Selch
