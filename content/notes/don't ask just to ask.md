What exactly is asking just to ask?

> “Can anyone help me?”

As opposed to

> “I have a [problem] and trying to [endgoal]. I have done [attempts] but [problem]. How can I achieve [endgoal]?”

This seems a pretty simple way of putting it, but if the next thing you say is going to be a question, you might as well ask the question right away. It’s less likely to waste people’s time, and by asking just to ask, you’re asking people <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">take responsibility</mark> for what you’re trying to do. Show them that you’re actually putting in effort to address your problem at hand by stating the **root problem, attempts you made at solving the problem, and your reasoning for such attempts**.

I notice I do this a lot, especially at work. Sometimes I would ask questions just for the sake of asking them, which makes me come across as not really thinking about things. In a profession that values critical thinking, this definitely comes off as lazy and something that I need to work on in order to foster critical thinking more.
