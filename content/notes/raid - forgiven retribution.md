*A humanoid Lightwarden who, upon closer inspection, resembles a certain Viis that many may know and hail as a hero to the people. Fewer still may know of the amount of violence he had to partake in in order to keep the populace safe, and for this reason does bloody violence mar the white and gold of the light-aspected weapons this Lightwarden wields.*

- Takes place in The Empty I guess?? Similar to Seat of Sacrifice maybe??
- Boss fight is a kind of amalgamation between Nameless King and Narukami no Mikoto.

# Phase 1 - The Warrior of Light (Anamnesis)
- Spawns in with either a spear or a scythe and moveset will correspond with weapon used; weapon will not change during this phase

## Movesets
- Spear
	- Tankbuster - 
	- Raidwide - Lunar Dive
		- Literally just does a dragoon dive like Stardiver
	- Point-blank AOE - 
		- Stabs the end of his spear to the ground and calls down light-aspected lightning right where he stands
	- Cone room-wide AOE - 
		- Flies to one side of the arena and swipes his spear outward in front of him; safe zones are directly next to him
	- Circle AOE - Sunlight Spear <3
		- Points his spear upward and summons several light-aspected lightning strikes that aim where players are standing
- Scythe
	- Tankbuster - 
	- Raidwide - 
	- Cone AOE - 
	- AOE - 
	- Cleave - 

# Phase 2 - Lightwarden of the First
- **Transformation into full Lightwarden mode causes a raidwide to 1HP + Doom**, healer check where Doom gets removed only if HP back to full + boss arena change

## Movesets
> Here he has different moves per weapon he holds, but there are no different variations; for example, if he has a cleave attack using his scythe, that specific cleave attack is done with the telegraph with the scythe and *only* that scythe.

- Tankbuster - 
- Raidwide - Death Unto Dark
- Light party stacks
- Cleave - tank has to turn the move to the rest of the raid to share the damage
- AOE 1: Circle + lines EVERYWHERE and it’s STRESSFUL (kinda like the final boss in Tower of Zot)
- Tower mech - Forest of Spears
- Fakeout where tower mech looks like the bad but it isn’t since his spears ARE the towers
- Telegraph + AOE

# Phase 3
- **QTE where everyone must succeed or the raid will wipe + boss arena back to the beginning**

## Movesets
- Akh Morn stack → creates a really fucked up image of Midgardsormr via light aether to mimic the attack
