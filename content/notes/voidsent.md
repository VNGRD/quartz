# Basics
- Beings whose aether is primarily tipped towards the Dark with a total absence of Light
- Where Light is stasis, Dark is energy
	- “Distorted, aether-starved remainders of the original lifeforms within the realm of the void (the Thirteenth)”
	- Excess energy = inability to truly die
	- Driven by unrestrained excesses and desires

# Hierarchy
- Strong rule over the weak; dog eat dog kind of world (literally)
	- Stronger voidsent are able to command weaker ones, not unlike Lightwardens and weaker sin eaters
