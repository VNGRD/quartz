I’m eating my words in real-time. 

The more I actively work on this garden, the more I’m seeing myself come back to old notes and updating its contents as I go. Currently, [[web-related concepts]] is the biggest victim (?) of this – obviously, considering how much of the foundations of learning are related to such concepts. How did I *not* think of that in advance? /s

That being said, it’s insanely cool seeing things connect with each other as this garden grows over time. Intentionality is a big part of this, it seems, and that’s something I can use a little more work on in real life too.

I also talked a little bit about this [here](https://www.schlaugh.com/~/RLEjmgF).
