## key points
- ==CHARACTER INSPIRATIONS:== Raiden Ei, Xie Lian
- ==KEYWORDS:== survivor, persistent, gentle, deadly, tranquil
- A friend to nature, a foe to those that dare being innocents, friends, and family to harm... and he strikes back at them with what one can call a surgical bloodthirst; a kind of storm beneath calm waters condensed into the deadly point of his spear.
	- Melee combat is his specialty, and he is very, *very* good at it. He gives credit to his abilities to his former Wood Warder master, who had a strong emphasis in combat during his training.
	- In the battlefield, people would describe him as a controlled chaos. His strikes are deliberate and precise, but he does so in blindingly fast fashion that this enemies are left to wonder what the hell just happened before they are cut to pieces.

# personality
- **A TRANQUIL SPIRIT →** Outside of battle and in places he deems safe, he lets down his guard and generally is calm, tranquil, and gentle. He loves to take naps under the shade of trees, as it reminds him of the forest he once called home. His demeanor makes it so that he is easily approachable by animals. It's not unusual to find him napping beneath a tree with a bird trying to nest in his long hair.
- **INTROVERTED HERO →** He does tend to keep to himself and honestly prefers it that way, which makes him feel very ill-suited for the more political side of things that the scions get involved with. He's just glad that the others are there to do the talking, as he would rather be pointed as a weapon toward the enemy instead.
	- *“If I am the weapon that must be wielded by the Scions - the one pointed at every enemy, be it they of the light or dark… then so be it.”*
- **FROSTED BLOODLUST →** During battle, it would be a wonder to get any words out of him if you were his enemy. His attitude becomes one of frostbite - silent and poised to kill.
	- Underneath the calm, he has a thirst for battle and bloodshed that can be rather frightening to others, even his comrades. His guilty pleasure is the thrill of dancing with death - nothing makes him feel both more alive and more appreciative of the world around him, and it makes him more protective of life as a whole. At one point (during Stomblood), this becomes dangerously close to a kind of self-harm, to the point that Aymeric had to stage an intervention at the behest of the Scions. At the same time, this bloodthirst is what draws Zenos towards him, and as a result he further enables that side of him.
- Social cues are definitely a challenge for him.

> *These violent delights have violent ends. (or, toxic yaoi realness)* 

<iframe style="border-radius:12px" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/playlist/7uhWvHSpPpirDdIyg4NSCZ?utm_source=generator" width="100%" height="152" frameBorder="0" allowfullscreen="" allow="autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; fullscreen; picture-in-picture" loading="lazy"></iframe>

The relationship these two share is very convoluted and complicated, with the only point holding them together being that of **ultraviolence**. Their personalities are two different kinds of cold and yet they clash all the same; Rune’s underlying heart is bathed in protective fury and Zenos’s is wrapped in wrathful glee. None of their encounters seem romantic either, at least to outsiders, and yet in some kind of sick way, Rune is the only one able to understand Zenos and how he ticks and Zenos with Rune. 

Where Aymeric and Estinien try to pull Rune back from the abyss that comes with his concerning enthusiasm regarding dancing with death, Zenos pulls him in further and ruins any kind of progress they may have made. (This is also what separates Rune from Zenos in terms of their similarities with their bloodlust - Rune has a support system and Zenos doesn’t. Because of that, it’s all Zenos knows, and why he continues to enable Rune’s behavior.) It’s not that Rune easily allows him to do so either; it’s something the Viera thoroughly despises him for and actively fights against for the sake of his loved ones. And yet, Zenos makes it too easy to fall back on bad habits.

On the flip side, Rune also enables Zenos's behavior by simply existing. To the crown prince, Rune was his “angel” that “came to bring him love (aka unfettered and unrestrained violence)” and he wants nothing more than it. The Viera becomes a sort of obsession for him, making him spiral down further into his own web of destruction; for prior to meeting Rune, his life was stagnant and he was unable to find the satisfaction he so craved in the war that comes with living. It probably wouldn't even come as a surprise if he ended up mistaking his obsession as love at some point. What kind of love, though, is anyone's guess. After all, what *wouldn't* he do for the one that brought color to his world, even if that color happened to be a deep scarlet? 

Overall, it’s a relationship deeply entrenched in their violent vices. It’s the only kind of language that they are able to speak to each other with, after all. There’s no flowers to be shared here, or for romantic songs to be sung. These two just really want to fucking kill each other and somehow the “do you think love can bloom on a battlefield” quote applies here.

> *Rune:* prommy? 🥺

> *Aymeric, back at base camp:* I get the feeling we need to send Rune back to therapy.
