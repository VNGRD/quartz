> *or, I place the ishgardian throuple in their own boss battles since I’m already doing one for Rune, Estinien already has one, and I think it would be neat if Aymeric also had one of his own too.*


- **Duty to what?** → They all have a parallel as the Warrior of Light, the Azure Dragoon, and the Lord Commander: duty to their people.
	- Rune: As the Warrior of Light, he has a duty to Eorzea and eventually Etheirys *and* its reflections as a whole. That being said, he can fully choose not to, and yet he does.
	- Estinien: As the Azure Dragoon, he has a duty to slay Nidhogg and restore peace to the people by ending the Dragonsong War. Dedicating himself to revenge against Nidhogg for the death of his family, he, too, chose to follow this duty.
	- Aymeric: As the Lord Commander, he has a duty to lead the Ishgard’s people to war against the dragons in the name of the Holy See. At the same time, he also has a duty to his father as his father’s son, who also happens to be the leader of the Holy See. In some ways, he chose this duty and in others, he did not.
- **How do they break away from this binding duty?**
	- Unfortunately, Rune doesn’t – or can’t. He is bound to his duty as a Warrior of Light, possibly until the end of his days. The title as the Warrior of Light is heavy on one’s shoulders, much like Atlas carrying the world. As such, this title can place him in multiple life-threatening situations – and canonically, it already does.
	- Estinien defeats the hold Nidhogg had over him and finds peace with himself with the help of his friends.
	- Aymeric breaks himself away from the Holy See almost immediately after finding out the truth of the Dragonsong War from Hraesvelgr.
- **What if they *don’t* break away?**
	- Rune: Married to his duty, basically, and very nearly turns into a Lightwarden because of it.
	- Estinien: Unable to let go of his grievances and his vendetta against Nidhogg, the dragon takes control of his anger and his body as a result.
	- Aymeric: This is only theoretical, since he was the only one that had sense out of the three – but if he was to follow in his father’s footsteps, what are the chances of him taking King Thordan’s place when the time comes?
- What I’m trying to say here is that these three have the potential for boss battles, with one already having one of his own (Nidstinien), just because I think it would be poetic and also cool if everyone in the throuple is more than able to pose as a very big threat in their own way.
	- Rune → Forgiven Retribution, the Lightwarden of the First → corruption of the Light
		- I’m legally obligated to mention [[lightwarden au logistics]] and [[raid - forgiven retribution]] right here.
			- Also [[the characteristics of the lightwarden of the first]] now as well, since I’m still brainrotting hard over this au.
		- 1st place in world-ending capabilities, but a very pretty boss fight nonetheless. Also an insanely stressful situation, both lorewise (au-wise?) and gameplay-wise. Honestly I’d make the fight an extreme trial just to be extra indulgent, but also because you’re literally fighting the Warrior of Light ~~no Elidibus not you go away~~.
	- Estinien → Vessel to Nidhogg → corruption of vengeance. Gave us the banger that is “Revenge of the Horde.”
		- Probably the scariest of the bunch in terms of visuals.
	- Aymeric → Heir to King Thordan? Look it’d be really cool okay → corruption of ~~nepotism LMAO~~ the sins of the father????
		- Has the potential to be really, really angsty – probably on the same level as the Lightwarden one, anyway. Possibly the weakest of the three in terms of power scaling since the power is based on how primals are created, but can deal a lot of emotional damage.
			- Now that I think about it, all of these situations can very much deal lots of emotional damage.

|        | Power scaling | Emotional damage | Gameplay difficulty                  |
| ------ | ------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| High   | Rune          | Rune, Aymeric    | All – they’re all extreme trials lol |
| Medium | Nidstinien    | Nidstinien       |                                      |
| Low    | Aymeric       |                  |                                      |
