Using the zettelkasten method did not work for me. I certainly tried my best, but in the end, there was a lot of entry friction for it to work. To me, it also seemed a bit too complex when in reality, I just wanted something *simple* that works for me - hence, this vault aptly named “Garden.”

Calling it “Garden” is a bit much, though. This vault is more akin to haphazardly throwing seeds into fertile ground and hoping something sprouts, rather than intentionally planting seeds. It’s certainly more chaotic that way, and definitely less organized, but if I stick to just using backlinks and tags, maybe I can make something  out of this. The most I’d probably do is just some kind of index page, and that’s it. Nothing too complex, I suppose. The most friction I’ll get out of this is slapping on a date and relevant tags.

Reading Jacky Zhao’s post on [Digital gardening](https://jzhao.xyz/posts/digital-gardening) and the overall [digital gardening “movement”](https://duckduckgo.com/?t=ffab&q=digital+gardening&atb=v357-1&ia=web) (is that even the right word?) certainly inspired me to take notes like this instead. To me, it’s kind of getting a large pinboard, slapping on notes wherever, and then using some kind of red yarn to make connections. In the end, I’ll probably just look like that [guy](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fcassiecreley.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2022%2F07%2FCharlie-Conspiracy.jpg&f=1&nofb=1&ipt=6058ba8fd959bd42da388f779d44505e5b809e838768cee09fa797b9a43d7044&ipo=images) with the detective board meme.
