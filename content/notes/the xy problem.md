> When asking for help with a problem, make sure you're asking about how to fix the problem rather than how to enact your attempted solution.

- Problems with asking about the attempt rather than the actual problem:
  1. It wastes people's time. Itâ€™s better to address the root problem than another problem that may not even be relevant in the long run.
  2. It makes the user believe that their attempted solution is the *actual* solution, when in reality, it might not actually be the solution at all.

- **Solution**: Always go broad regarding your problem rather than being specific. If asked, provide  details as needed. If you rule out something before asking about the problem, say *why* you ruled it out.**
