- “A personification of the resentment aroused in men by those who committed crimes with apparent impunity (exemption from punishment, penalty, or harm) or had inordinate good fortune”
	- Other descriptors: “moral reverence for the law, of the natural fear of committing a culpable action, and hence of conscience”
		- Deliverer of inescapable divine vengeance, especially when she is usually depicted with wings
			- Gods with wings are depicted as messengers = Nemesis, the messenger of vengeance
	- The balance to Tyche providing good fortune
- Parentage:
	- Daughter of Nyx (Night), though some will say that she is the daughter of Erebus (personification of darkness) or Oceanus; sometimes even Zeus.
		- Pairings: Oceanus and Tethys, Zeus and someone else (lol), Nyx and Erebus, or only Nyx
	- Most often she will be described as the child of Nyx and Erebus, though.
- Not necessarily evil and instead represents one half of a balance with Tyche. She is a very morally grey goddess otherwise.
