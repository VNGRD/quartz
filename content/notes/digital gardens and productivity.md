There’s something about [this article](https://nesslabs.com/mind-garden) that rubs me the wrong way in such a way that’s also hard to pin down, so I’ll try to word it as best as I can in a braindump. Bear with me 🐻

- The term “increased productivity” already sucks. Why does it suck?
	- Increased productivity??? In this economy????
	- The sidebar: “Want to invest into your productivity and your mental health?”
		- Something about this just makes me think of productivity gurus and–
			- “[This newsletter] is packed with mindful productivity strategies to be more productive and creative without sacrificing your mental health.” How many times can you slap on “productive” in a sentence?
		- Words that stand out to me:
			- **Invest**
			- Productivity (obviously)
- I’m not knocking on them for having a focus on improving mental health. That’s great! Everyone should focus on doing so. But there’s just *something* about it all that just really, *really* bothers me and I don’t know what it is.
