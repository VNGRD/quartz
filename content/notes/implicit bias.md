# What is implicit bias?
- ==Implicit bias== helps people make decisions more efficiently by working with patterns and categories
	- Because of the speed these inferences and decisions are made, the associations are not always accurate
	- People in society are generally sorted by:
		- skin color
		- ethnic origin
		- age
		- weight or height
		- accent or speech patterns
		- disability
		- physical appearance or ability
		- gender identity
		- sexual orientation
		- socioeconomic status or title
		- domestic circumstances
	- **No one is immune from bias and biases don’t make people bad - they make people human**

# 5 types of unconscious bias

> [!faq] How does one reduce their biases?
> The first step to reducing your biases is to identify them.

- ==AFFINITY BIAS==: the tendency to gravitate or give preference towards people who are similar to yourself
	- People are naturally inclined to give value and give importance to things that are relevant to them personally
		- In this way people tend to surround themselves with people with similar interests, qualities, and backgrounds
	- *Are my strong feelings about a person or thing based on similarities or differences to me?*
- ==PERCEPTION BIAS==: making assumptions about people based on their gender identity, race/ethnicity, religion, physical appearance or perceived ability, intro/extroversion, sexual orientation, background or economic status, marital or parental status, and age
	- *How do labels and assumptions factor into my feelings?*
- ==CONFIRMATION BIAS==: tendency to only seek out information that further confirms your preconceived notions or beliefs
	- This creates an **echo chamber** in which you find only supporting information when you look for information that confirms your assumptions
	- *What information do I miss by ‘confirming’ what I think I know? Have I considered counterarguments?*
- ==GROUPTHINK==: tendency for people to conform or go along with the group rather than forming and expressing a differing opinion
	- This is largely due to humans being social creatures and wanting to fit in, whether that is consciously or subconsciously
	- *Would I think differently if my opinion were anonymous?*
- ==THE HALO AND HORNS EFFECT==:
	- ==HALO==: when you’re so focused on the good qualities of a person or situation that you overlook anything bad
	- ==HORNS==: when you let one negative quality about a person or situation overshadow anything good
		- *Am I overlooking objectively positive or negative traits and behaviors based on past experiences with this person?*

# The consequences of bias
- **If a person is presented friction - in which the brain’s tendencies are interrupted - then they are more likely to slow down, which in turn prevents biases from turning into harmful actions**
- Workplace consequences of unconscious bias:
	- stifled creativity
	- unfair performance evaluations
	- unequal circumstances
	- arbitrary growth opportunities
> *“Avoid harmful or negative behavior by slowing down and reflecting on quick-moving thoughts… To create a fair and inclusive workplace, it’s imperative to take a step back and reflect.”*
