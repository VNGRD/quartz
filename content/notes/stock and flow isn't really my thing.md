- ==Stock==: the things that stick around, like published books, etc.
- ==Flow==: tweets, ephemeral stuff
- don’t really vibe with it
	- has the “content creator” mindset that I don’t really subscribe (lol) to
- I’m not really looking to actively share what “stock” I have – I just put it out there as a digital garden as a kind of way to keep myself going with this kind of thing. Accountability isn’t really the right word for it, but same idea
- What is my stock?
	- This digital garden?? My art? My site??? My writing??
	- A sketchbook vs a published novel (or whatever that guy published that was mentioned in the essay)
- What is my flow?
	- I don’t really have one except for my tumblr which shall not be named. And that barely even counts since what’s on there pertains to my interests but not about my actual *personal* stuff
