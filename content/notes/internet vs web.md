# What is the internet?
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">INTERNET</mark>: the *hardware*; the physical connections of cords and cables that connect servers together. (The cable management for this thing must be insane)
- In better wording, it’s the “technical infrastructure.”
- Computers can be connected physically or wirelessly in order to communicate with each other.
	- This communication is not limited to two computers only.

> [!NOTE] How is data sent from one computer to another?
> Computer #1 → router → modem → internet service provider (ISP) → modem → router → Computer #2

## Communication terminology

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ROUTER</mark>: a tiny computer that a computer / multiple computers can connect to; it allows messages to be sent from one computer to another.
- A router based in one network (a collection of computers connected to each other) can connect to another router based in another network.
- Routers also use modems in order to more effectively connect to other networks outside of your own.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">MODEM</mark>: a “translator” that translates information from one network into information more accessible by the telephone infrastructure and send it outward to an internet service provider
- Telephone infrastructure is relevant here as these already physically connect one house to another, so to speak.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER (ISP)</mark>: a provider that has its own network of routers that has the ability to connect to other ISPs’ routers

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">INTERNET PROTOCOL (IP) ADDRESS</mark>: the unique combination of numbers that identifies a specific computer connected to a network

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">DOMAIN NAME</mark>: aliases that IP addresses can have for human readability ^62944a
- Example → IP address 142.250.190.78 = Domain name *google.com*

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">PACKETS</mark>: information broken down in order for it to travel through the internet and reassembled once it reaches its destination.

# What is the web?
<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">WORLD WIDE WEB</mark>: the *software*, so to speak; uses the internet to present information to the user in the form of wepbages, documents, etc.

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">INTRANET</mark>: **a private network** restricted to members of an organization, meaning that it’s inaccessible from the outside via conventional means.
- Example → the Sharepoint page at work

<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">EXTRANET</mark>: a more **open** version of an intranet that allows different organizations to collaborate with each other in one network, as opposed to the network being closed to only one organization (aka intranet)
