<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Ports are communication endpoints that directs data to a specific service. Each port has its own designated number that act as a gate used to access resources and services.</mark>

- It is **not** a kind of physical hardware present in a computer
- Below 1024, each port is associated by default with a specific [[web-related concepts#Terms|protocol]].
	- For example, HTTP listens on port 80 while HTTPS listens on port 443.
- Services, such as email/web/file/print services, can all run at the same time in one computer and share the same IP address.
	- Ports allow each individual service to be kept apart despite having the same IP address.
		- **Think of an IP address as an apartment building and each port is the different apartments.**

> [!tip] As part of the apartment analogyâ€¦
> If you want to send a letter to someone that lives in a different apartment complex, they will obviously have a different address (IP address) and apartment number (port). The same idea applies here.
