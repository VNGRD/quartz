- ==COZY WEB==: private, gatekeeper-bound spaces of the internet that **are uninformal, untracked, and messily human** and haven’t been infiltrated by bots or algorithms
	- Spaces in the internet where it’s possible to be *human* d/t “the non-indexed, non-optimized, and non-gamified environment” (Yancey Strickler, [The Dark Forest Theory of the Internet](https://onezero.medium.com/the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet-7dc3e68a7cb1)) that these spaces tend to have
		- EX: messaging apps, emails, cloud storage services, private groups
	- This idea builds off of the “dark forest” theory of the web
		- ==DARK FOREST THEORY==: a place that appears to be devoid of life, but only because the animals must stay quiet and in hiding to prevent attracting predators
			- The predators in this case are “the advertisers, tracking bots, clickbait creators, attention-hungry influencers, reply guys, and trolls. It is unsafe to reveal yourself to them in any authentic way.”
				- *Why is it unsafe to reveal your authentic self to these predators?* ***Because they can use your information against you for potential harm***
	- It’s referred to as cozy because in some respects it is more *private* compared to places like Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.
- **Domestic cozy?** → “It’s the digital realm of ‘Domestic Cozy’ Gen-Z vibes. Casual, comfy, and not trying to kick up a fuss.”
	- Best seen in private online spaces shared with friends rather than strangers where there’s no need to “perform,” so to speak
	- The antithesis to “premium mediocre”
