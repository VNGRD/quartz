or, rune goes to tataru with an unexpected request.

notes:
- from arr to endwalker, rune has pretty much let his hair grow out down to his waist. due to the hectic back-to-back situations between the war for ala mhigo, the issue of the lightwardens in the first, and then eventually the telophoroi and the final days, rune was never really able to find much time to cut his hair.
	- by endwalker, his hair is very long and also very choppy, as it was inadvertently cut in some parts during fights.
- prior to journeying to tural, rune approaches tataru and asks her if she can cut his hair properly. she is very surprised at the request but also accepts.
- it's rather symbolic of him shedding the weight off his shoulders after saving the universe from the endsinger.
