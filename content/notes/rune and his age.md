- changing his age to 29 to better suit age ranges with love interests and also it's gonna be hard writing a 66 year old properly?? there's a lot that can happen in those years
	- now born 1548 instead of 1511 and gives the Imperial legion more reason to actually try and infiltrate the Viera homelands
	- will also still be old enough to experience the umbral calamity (22 y/o)
	- d/t lack of deeper lore knowledge regarding the dalmascan rebellion, changing his age will also allow me to cut out that part entirely
		- this however means that his combat prowess in lore is less due to decades of veteran combat experience and more of a combination of both experience (to a much lesser degree) and prodiguous fighting skills.
	- 29 i think is a good age where you can have a mix between having some experience while also still being capable of making stupid mistakes due to the youthness of your age.
		- *especially* with as the wol you can make some pretty reckless and stupid decisions. that isnt to say that older people also do so but it's much less likely than compared to a 29 y/o
		- also makes the attraction to a certain dude more feasible bc an older person can look at him and think he's just dumb
